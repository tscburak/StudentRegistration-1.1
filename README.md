# StudentRegistration-1.1
That is the updated version of first StudentRegistration project


Update Notes:


  For General:
   - Selected panel button is more dark than the other one anymore.

  For Registration Screen:
   - I tried to do more dinamic the program. I added ActionListener to textFields. The listeners, listen all event on textFields and they check the conditions.
      For example: When the user fill name & surname & mail fields the save button will be active. 
  
   - When the user add & update a student, the information which in textFields will be deleted.
    
   For Students Screen:
   - Added "More Details" button to see more information about the selected student. 
   
   - Changed the table view. Cutted some columns and tried to show summary data on table. If the users want to see details about the student, they can click "More Detail" button
    and they can see the details.
      
   - Unless the user choose an checkBox and write some text on search textField, Search button will not be active.
      
   - When the user select a student from the table, then delete & edit & more details buttons will be active.
